## Game Concept

The falling numbers game is a web-based interactive experience where players control a draggable bucket to catch falling numbers from 1 to 10 in sequential order. The objective is to catch the correct numbers and allow the others to fall without catching the wrong ones. Missing a number doesn't end the game, but catching the wrong number results in a game over.
